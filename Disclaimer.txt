!!! This project was done exclusively for educational purposes. !!!

I do not condone the use of this virus in any capacity past the print statement payload. It is important to know the functionality of 
malware in order to protect against malware. Learning how they are made will aid me in my efforts to protect myself and any future 
employers with proper practicces. 

Some safety measures within this project:
 - Payload is harmless.
 - Can only infect within the current directory.
 - If anyone tries to use this as a foundation to make a more harmful virus they would have to change quite a bit of the
   memory organization within the virus, which means they could have probably made this themselves.
 - I wrote it on a VM, and if you use this I suggest you do the same.
